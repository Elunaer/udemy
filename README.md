I'm currently working on a few projects via Udemy Complete ruby guide course. This repository will store some of the projects as part of the
complete Ruby on Rails developer course.

## Projects will include
* [ ] Random mini projects & Homework to solidify knowledge from the course so these may seem random (but are all necessary for showing growth)
* [ ] MessageMe chat app using action cable and web sockets 
* [ ] Stock Tracker Social media app 
* [ ] Project management app 

### Homework assignments 
* [X] Simple Calculator

### Simple Calculator 
My task was to: 

Create a simple calculator that takes in 2 numbers and then returns the multiplication, division, addition and subtraction of the numbers entered. I decided to 
add a few things of my own just to make it a little more user friendly. Including a couple of validation checks. I'm sure there are better ways to do it but this is what I ended 
up with and I'm pretty happy with it. Originally as the assignement was set it asked that you entered 2 whole numbers, there were no checks needed to be made for whether what was entered was a number, letter etc
and for the part where you would select the operator the homework was to create a list (ie for multiplication press 1 and so on) so I decided to add the proper operator  
checks and then I also added some checks for decimal points as well which wasn't required. 

Although this seems really simple (and it is) I am really proud of myself because I have no prior programming knowledge and to build something  
like this just makes me super proud! 

To use the calculator just open your terminal and then:
```
ruby simple_calculator.rb
```
It should then look something like this:
```
Hello, I am a simple calculator. I will ask you for two numbers and then I will return the multiplication, addition, subtraction, modular value and division of the numbers.
So what is the first number? Remember you can use whole numbers and decimal points
```
then you can enter any number you like including float numbers
```
10.56
```
