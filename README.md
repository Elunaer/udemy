I'm currently working on a few projects via Udemy. This repository will store some of the projects as part of the
complete Ruby on Rails developer course. 

Projects will include:
Random mini projects to solidify knowledge from the course so these may seem random (but are all necessary for showing growth)
MessageMe chat app using action cable and web sockets
Stock Tracker Social media app
Project management app
